function [data, f, dw] = plotMaudsFromSpike2(filename, nchannel, fest, showemas, startsec, endsec, offsetsec, boxed, potentialoffset)
% Process and plot a data vector from a spike2 export txt file with Mauds algorithm

% filename: name of the export txt file from Spike2 that contains the recorded signal
% nchannel: num channel in the export file to process 
% fest: estimated frequency of the signal (a parameter of mauds algorithm)
% showemas: include the emas in the plot
% startsec: start second to process
% endsec: end second to process (0 = end)
% offsetsec: start second to plot
% boxed: plot characterization with boxes (1) or changing signal color (0)
% potentialoffset: potential offset to aply to data vector
