function [data, f, dw] = plotMaudsFromMat(filename, fest, showemas, startsec, endsec, offsetsec, boxed, potentialoffset)
% Process and plot a data vector from a mat file with Mauds algorithm

% filename: file that contains the data vector to process and the sampling frequency of data
% fest: estimated frequency of the signal (a parameter of mauds algorithm)
% showemas: include the emas in the plot
% startsec: start second to process
% endsec: end second to process (0 = end)
% offsetsec: start second to plot
% boxed: plot characterization with boxes (1) or changing signal color (0)
% potentialoffset: potential offset to aply to data vector
